### Prerequisites 📋

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [NPM](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.

```
node@v10.16.0 or higher
npm@6.9.0 or higher
git@2.17.1 or higher
```

Also, you can use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead of NPM ☝️

yarn@v1.21.1 or higher
```
